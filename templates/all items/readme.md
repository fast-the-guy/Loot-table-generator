this is a pre made loot table.

for this loot table i used the spredsheet at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QTsnLFqjG1YQ0siEPl4shL7jXKkWCYl3Hoo9YcvfL5k/edit?usp=drivesdk) to make the input for my program

and i used visual studeo code with an exstention to fix some issues made by enchanted books, and other items that dont have the same name,

like grass block and Minecraft:grass_block are the same as i converted from the names,

but bottle o' enchanting will not be converted to minecraft:experience_bottle by adding minecraft: and replacing space with _

note that this prosses was not done in the program.

note that this was only made for 1.21.4 and will not be updated, unless i sometime want to, this is just a thing i made for fun

note that enchanted books are not included
